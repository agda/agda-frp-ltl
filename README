This is an implementation of Functional Reactive Programming in Agda,
with types given as LTL formulae.

The top-level module is FRP.LTL.

The specification is given in terms of "reactive types", defined in FRP.LTL.RSet.

The implementation is given in term of "interval types", defined in FRP.LTL.ISet.

This library makes use of experimental features of Agda, and compiles
